## Starting Your Server

The webapp uses ReactJS for it's frontend and Django for it's backend.

To start the server and run the webapp. Go to terminal and run commands:

1. cd **django_react_starter/frontend** (make sure you are in the curlec_work directory first)
2. **npm run dev**
3. cd **..**
4. **py manage.py runserver**

## General Info

- The developement server will start at port 8000 and needs to be refreshed to show changes made in the code (Ctrl + F5 if changes aren't showing even after refresh)

- Bootstrap was used to speed up development. The bootstrap css has been imported to `/django_react_starter/frontend/static/css/main.css` so if you need to style anything edit that file (there is no need to edit the actual bootstrap files in the node_modules).

- All the things that need to be done/fixed in each react component are added at the bottom of the component's `.js` files in `/django_react_starter/frontend/src/components`.

- The images used in this code are stored in `django_react_starter/images`. Currently they are sourced from imgur but you can change the src if you want in `index.html` file at `/django_react_starter/frontend/templates/frontend/index.html`.

- Python packages used are in `requirements.txt` file and all js packages used are in the two `node_modules` folders.

- There are comments in the files to explain further details about the code

Feel free to clean up any bad code/bad practices as this webapp was coded by 17-year-old high school students :)
